Project Naharkatia is a small initiative by a group of friends. We’ve been born and bred in Naharkatia and it has made us what we are today.

We wanted to give back to our town and uplift deserving people. There are lots of talented and skilled people who could do much more with just a little help.

So, we introduced our very first initiative – The Naharkatia Scholarship.

Every two months, we’ll be awarding the scholarship to the best deserving candidate([click here](/posts/how-is-the-winner-selected) to know how we choose the winner) and provide them with Rs. 50,000.

But, it doesn’t end here.

We’ll also support them on their journey to growth and excellence. How will we do that? Click here to read more.

Moving ahead, we also want to work on cleaning the town as it has become really polluted. The government and authorities can only do much. As citizens, it’s also our duty to act responsibly and do as much as possible for the well-being of our town.

We’re a small team and we’re always looking for interested people to join us and work together. If you think you could contribute to the project in any way, feel free to drop your resume at [projectnaharkatia@gmail.com](mailto:projectnaharkatia@gmail.com).
