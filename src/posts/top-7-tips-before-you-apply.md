Through our scholarship, we aim to seek the exceptional. We want to give deserving individuals an actual shot at making it big. To put it in a nutshell, if you actually deserve the scholarship, nothing is going to deprive you of it.

However, there are some factors that make your application more attractive which might just increase your chances of scoring it rather effortlessly. Here are a few tips to keep in mind while applying for the scholarship.

## 1. Check the form carefully after filling it up

This is the best tip we can possibly give to the applicants. It would be tragic if a person who actually deserves the scholarship is deprived of it due to some missing or inaccurate data. So, make sure every entry on the form is properly reviewed. Also, don’t forget the deadline for submission of the form.

## 2. Make your application unique

It gets rather boring when you have the same format repeat itself in the description section of every application. Use the form liberally and try to grab the attention of the experts effectively while still being honest and grounded about yourself and your achievements.

## 3. Chose your references wisely

The people that refer you should have authentic testimonials. The more the person knows you, the better he/she will endorse you. Try to get them from teachers or people that have actually seen your work.

## 4. Let us know your vision

We want people who make use of the scholarship for their growth. It’s extremely important that you know what to do once you get the scholarship. So, try to think about what’s next when you fill out the section about your course of action once you get it.

## 5. Be confident about your skills

Lack of confidence is a genuine issue that many of you might face. You might feel like a particular achievement is not worth mentioning, or nobody cares about it. Trust me, we do. We would love to know every nitty-gritty detail of your journey, and who knows, the achievements you didn’t want to mention might even be the determining factor that scores you that scholarship!

## 6. Be realistic

No one likes a pretentious guy, right? You cannot possibly run 10 businesses, excel in your studies and be a national-level cricket player simultaneously. Boasting big won’t help your cause in any way. Try to keep your description pragmatic and mention all of the things that you care about and have achieved without exaggerating anything.

## 7. Most importantly, be patient

These scholarships come down to luck sometimes because you may achieve great things on your own that are actually commendable but still lose out on competition as some other person has an application that is perceived to be just better. Don’t beat yourself up if that happens.

In these situations, all you can do is keep working harder, which will definitely help and develop a stronger application for the next month.

And that’s it. Remember the tips when you apply, and you’re golden. We wish you all the best for your future. Keep on hustling.
