Dear Parents…

Giving your children access to good education is every parent’s responsibility. But your responsibility doesn’t end there.

Along with good education, you must try to provide them with access to co-curricular activities, let them explore their interests, and, most importantly, show interest in what they pursue.

Getting your child enrolled in a good school isn’t enough. Asking them to study isn’t enough.

You must learn with them. Share their joys and sorrows together. Be more connected.

A child spends most of their day with their peers. Good or bad, they learn a lot from the people around them.

Be the person to teach your child the good and filter out the bad.

Be your child’s mentor. Their best friend.

Encourage your child to pursue what they truly love. Your child might be an average academic student but good at football. Praise them and support them to pursue football.

Help them learn the balance between pursuing academics and their interests.
