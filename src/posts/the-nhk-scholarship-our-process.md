The Naharkatia Scholarship isn’t like traditional scholarships. We’ll award the winner Rs. 50,000. **But that’s not it.**

Along with the money, we’ll give you **access to both online and offline courses** to help you grow in your respective forte.

Additionally, **we’ll find mentors worldwide** to guide you and help you improve.

If you require certain equipment(for example, a 3D artist will need a powerful rig), items, goods, or supplies, we’ll try our best to accommodate you with the same.

We’ll stay in touch with you for the next **three months**, help you train, focus, and achieve your goals.

Money is just the first layer.

**The important layers are what comes after it.**
