Whether you’re insanely good at drawing those Harry Potter fan arts or are rapidly climbing up the ranks on that new competitive video game, we have got it all covered. Graduates, students, people who have never even seen the face of the school, and practically anyone below the age of 27 can take a look at our scholarship. To stand a chance to win it, you have to be:

- Below 27 years of age at the time of registration
- A resident of Naharkatia
- And most importantly, you have to make the best out of the opportunities given to you relating to any skills or ideas that you possibly have

That’s it. Nothing more.

Initially, we planned to award the scholarship to people with three eyes, but now we are also willing to give it to anyone our panel believes will make the best out of it. Yes! that could be you. A sad day for the three-eyed community.

All awardees of the scholarship should share a passion for whatever they do and must have the flexibility to adjust their ideas and flairs to pursue their project successfully.

We at Project Naharkatia have a panel of experts specializing in a diverse range of fields who will judge the applicants based on their achievements, talents and vision for the future.

If you can convince the panel that you have the greatest accolades in your skills as per the opportunities given to you and will make the most out of the scholarship and the added perks that come with it, congratulations! you scored it.

If not, and the panel considers you to be good at what you do, you still score a talent management deal where your skills will be managed and marketed by the team, and you can still try to make a career out of your flairs and ideas.

This also puts you in contention for the next month’s award, as you will be presented with better opportunities under our team.
