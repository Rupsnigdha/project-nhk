Giving away Rs. 50,000 every once in a while **isn’t a small deal**.

So, how are we doing it? Where is the money coming from?

Currently, we’re two people. **Pingal Pratyush Singh**, and **Amartya Kaushik**. We’re both students; I (Pingal) graduated from Delhi College of Arts and Commerce, University of Delhi in Journalism. Amartya is pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science from Jorhat Engineering College.

I own a video game news website called Spiel Times, which does decent business every month. From my monthly income, I save as much as I can to run this charity.

Once I accumulate Rs. 50,000, we at Project Naharkatia give out another scholarship.

The scholarship, as of now, is being distributed only **through saved-up funds**.

In the future, however, we wish to meet with businessmen around Naharkatia to see if they’d be interested in sponsoring the scholarship for certain months.

We’re also **accepting donations** from everyone. If you want Naharkatia to grow and the deserving talents to get a headstart in their careers, you can donate to us by [clicking here](/posts/donate-to-project-naharkatia).

Currently, we’re planning to run the scholarship for as long as our bank accounts are happy.

**We hope to see donations and sponsorships from the general people so we can keep running this initiative.**
